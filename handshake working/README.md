"# TCP-Visualizer" 
This project is designed to capture live data from a chrome browser, using speedtest.org to capture TCP and youtube.com to capture UDP. The user is prompted to enter the number of packets desired to capture, once the number is entered the user should have the speedtest.org site open and allow for it to begin capturing once it is done captureing, the user will need to enter the youtube.com and select a video to play, once then select 'okay' on the prompt in order for the program to begin capturing UDP. Once it has finished capturing the files GUI will pop-up and visualize the data in three different graphs. As well as display the handshake for TCP.
